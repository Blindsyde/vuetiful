# Vuetiful

Vuetiful is a component framework written on top of the Vue reactive library. It is primarily designed for creating business/administration applications where the displaying of data is paramount. Although targeted primarily at business applications, Vuetiful is extremely flexible and easily themed making it trivial to integrate into any website.

**Update:** *Due to time limitations this project has been discontinued by the original author. Please feel free to use or distribute any of the code in this repo as per the license below.*

## Getting started
This project is still very much in the early days of development so it is not currently available on nuget (but will be soon). 

To use the components simply download the `components.bundle.js` and `app.style.css` files from the `/dist` directory and link to them in your html.
